# COVID-19 Outcome Prediction Models

## Overview
This repository contains the work of a team project aimed at developing predictive models for COVID-19 outcomes. The project makes use of a dataset collected by the CDC and utilizes different machine learning algorithms to predict the mortality outcome ('death_yn') for each patient.

## Team Members
- Tania Lopes - Data Preparation, Random Forest Model, and Optimization Lead
- [Emma Cassar Torreggiani](https://github.com/Da-Em-Dawg) - Linear and Logistic Regression Model Lead

## Features
### Overview
The project aims to:
1. Prepare and clean the dataset for predictive modeling.
2. Implement and evaluate three types of predictive models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
3. Optimize the models to improve predictive accuracy.

### Data Preparation
- **Initial Cleaning**: Steps to deal with missing or inconsistent entries.
- **Feature Selection**: Identification of correlated features to improve model performance.
- **Data Normalization**: Techniques employed to format the data for compatibility with specific models.

### Implemented Models
1. **Linear Regression Model**: With a focus on normalization and handling of class imbalance.
2. **Logistic Regression Model**: With a focus on normalization and handling of class imbalance.
3. **Random Forest Model**: With a focus on optimization and feature selection techniques.

### Model Optimization
- **Class Imbalance**: Utilized oversampling and undersampling techniques.
- **Feature Selection**: Ongoing process to enhance model performance without overfitting.
- **Depth Control**: Limiting the maximum depth in Random Forest model to avoid excessive complexity.

### Performance Metrics
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for performance evaluation.
- **Optimization Outcomes**: Detailed discussion about how optimization techniques affected model performance.

### Technologies
- **Python**: Jupyter Notebooks, sklearn for model building.
